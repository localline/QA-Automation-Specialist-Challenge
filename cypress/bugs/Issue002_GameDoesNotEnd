Steps to reproduce:

3) Click on the bottom left box to place an O.
4) Click on the center left box to place another X.
5) Click on the center middle box to place an O.
6) Click on the center right box to place another X.
7) Click on the top right box to place an O.
8) Observe that the game allows Player X or O to continue playing by clicking on   
   the top left box, even though the game should have declared a winner.

Expected result:

The game should declare a winner for Player O and prevent any further moves from being made.

Actual result:

The game allows Player X or O to continue playing, even though the game should have ended.

Description:

While testing the Tic Tac Toe game on Google Chrome, I noticed that the game allows Player X or O to continue playing after the game has ended. This occurs when Player X or O has three consecutive X's or O's in a row and the game should declare a winner.
